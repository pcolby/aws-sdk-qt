 *  <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using
 *  Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon
 *  Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can
 *  launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block
 *  level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can
 *  be attached to any running instance and used like a hard
 * 
 *  drive>
