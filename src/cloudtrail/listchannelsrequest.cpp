 *  This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common

 *  CloudTrail>
 * 
 *  CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers
 *  log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the
 *  Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the
 * 
 *  service> <note>
 * 
 *  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample
 *  code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide
 *  programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and
 *  retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
 *  install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools to Build on Amazon Web
 * 
 *  Services</a>> </note>

 *  See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">CloudTrail User
