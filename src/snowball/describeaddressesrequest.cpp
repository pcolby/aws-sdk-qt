 *  AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data
 *  between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described here
 *  provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which enables you
 *  to create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to use the
 *  Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more information,
 *  see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
