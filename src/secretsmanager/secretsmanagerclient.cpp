 * token, or other secret information that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also includes the
 * connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets

 *
 * To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the <code>SecretString</code> parameter
 * or the <code>SecretBinary</code> parameter, but not both. If you include <code>SecretString</code> or
 * <code>SecretBinary</code> then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging

 * of a database

 * you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use
 * <code>aws/secretsmanager</code>. Creating <code>aws/secretsmanager</code> can result in a one-time significant delay in

 * If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a
 * rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already
 * stored in the secret.
 *
 * </p
 *
 * For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the
 * secret value is in the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_secret_json_structure.html"> JSON structure
 * of a database secret</a>. In particular, if you want to use the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets_strategies.html#rotating-secrets-two-users">
 * alternating users strategy</a>, your secret must contain the ARN of a superuser
 *
 * secret>
 *
 * To configure rotation, you also need the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and the schedule for the
 * rotation. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the
 * database or service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the
 * staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code>. Then anyone who retrieves the secret gets the new version. For more information,
 * see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_how.html">How rotation
 *
 * works</a>>
 *
 * You can create the Lambda rotation function based on the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/reference_available-rotation-templates.html">rotation
 * function templates</a> that Secrets Manager provides. Choose a template that matches your <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets_strategies.html">Rotation
 *
 * strategy</a>>
 *
 * When rotation is successful, the <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging label might be attached to the same version as the
 * <code>AWSCURRENT</code> version, or it might not be attached to any version. If the <code>AWSPENDING</code> staging
 * label is present but not attached to the same version as <code>AWSCURRENT</code>, then any later invocation of
 * <code>RotateSecret</code> assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an
 *
