 *
 *  <fullname>AWS IoT</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS IoT provides secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices (such as sensors, actuators,
 *  embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. You can discover your custom IoT-Data endpoint to communicate
 *  with, configure rules for data processing and integration with other services, organize resources associated with each
 *  device (Registry), configure logging, and create and manage policies and credentials to authenticate
 * 
 *  devices>
 * 
 *  The service endpoints that expose this API are listed in <a
 *  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html">AWS IoT Core Endpoints and Quotas</a>. You must use
 *  the endpoint for the region that has the resources you want to
 * 
 *  access>
 * 
 *  The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">AWS Signature
 *  Version 4</a> to sign the request is:
 * 
 *  <i>execute-api</i>>
