 *  AWS Transfer for SFTP is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files directly into and out of Amazon S3
 *  using the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)—also known as Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol. AWS helps you
 *  seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer for SFTP—by integrating with existing authentication
 *  systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53—so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their
 *  applications. With your data in S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and
 *  archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer for SFTP (AWS SFTP) is easy; there is no infrastructure to buy and setup.
