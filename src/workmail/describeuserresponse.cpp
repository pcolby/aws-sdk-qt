 * \inmodule QtAwsWorkMail
 *
 *  Amazon WorkMail is a secure, managed business email and calendaring service with support for existing desktop and mobile
 *  email clients. You can access your email, contacts, and calendars using Microsoft Outlook, your browser, or their native
 *  iOS and Android email applications. You can integrate Amazon WorkMail with your existing corporate directory and control
 *  both the keys that encrypt your data and the location in which your data is
 * 
 *  stored>
 * 
 *  The Amazon WorkMail API is designed for the following
 * 
 *  scenarios> <ul> <li>

 * 
 *  All Amazon WorkMail API actions are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 *  AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 *  policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkMail site, the IAM user gains full
 *  administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkMail organization (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but
 *  is not limited to, the ability to create, update, and delete users, groups, and resources. This allows developers to
 *  perform the scenarios listed above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM
