 * \brief The RebootDBInstanceResponse class provides an interace for RDS RebootDBInstance responses.

 *  <fullname>Amazon Relational Database Service</fullname>
 * 
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
 *  relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational
 *  database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their
 *  applications and businesses
 * 
 *  unique>
 * 
 *  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon
 *  Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your
 *  existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and
 *  maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's
 *  compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no
 *  up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you
 * 
 *  use>
 * 
 *  This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use
 *  to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
 *  such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter
 *  descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance
 *  window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user
