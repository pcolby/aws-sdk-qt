 * \class QtAws::CodeDeploy::DeleteDeploymentConfigResponse
 * \brief The DeleteDeploymentConfigResponse class provides an interace for CodeDeploy DeleteDeploymentConfig responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsCodeDeploy
 *
 *  <fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname>
 * 
 *  AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises
 *  instances running in your own facility, or serverless AWS Lambda
 * 
 *  functions>
 * 
 *  You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, code, web and
 *  configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application
 *  content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to
 *  your existing code before you can use AWS
 * 
 *  CodeDeploy>
 * 
 *  AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application
 *  deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
 *  error-prone manual

 *  deployments>
 * 
 *  <b>AWS CodeDeploy Components</b>
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy
 * 
 *  components> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name,
 *  which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment
 *  group are referenced during a
 * 
 *  deployment> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual instances or CodeDeploy Lambda applications. A Lambda deployment group
 *  contains a group of applications. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2
 *  instances in Auto Scaling groups, or both.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS
 *  CodeDeploy during a
 * 
 *  deployment> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used in the process of updating a Lambda function or of installing
 *  content on one or more instances.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Application revisions</b>: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function
 *  to update and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is
 *  an archive file containing source content—source code, web pages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an
 *  AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely
 *  identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by
 *  its commit
 * 
 *  ID> </li> </ul>
 * 
 *  This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make
 *  on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, and to get details about a Lambda function
 *
