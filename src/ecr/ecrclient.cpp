 * @class  EcrClient

 * @brief  Client for Amazon EC2 Container Registry ( ECR)
 *
 * Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed AWS Docker registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry. Amazon ECR supports private Docker repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images. Developers can use the Docker CLI to author and manage images.
