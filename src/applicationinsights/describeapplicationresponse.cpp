 *  <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server is a service that helps you detect common problems with
 *  your .NET and SQL Server-based applications. It enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your applications (built
 *  with technologies such as Microsoft IIS, .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into detected
 * 
 *  problems>
 * 
 *  After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights for .NET and SQL Server identifies, recommends, and
 *  sets up metrics and logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to surface
 *  actionable problems with your application. For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP
 *  500 errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you that a memory pressure problem with
 *  your SQL Server database is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.
