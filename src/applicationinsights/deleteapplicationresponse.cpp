 *  <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights is a service that helps you detect common problems with your applications. It
 *  enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your applications (built with technologies such as Microsoft IIS, .NET,
 *  and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into detected
 * 
 *  problems>
 * 
 *  After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and
 *  logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to surface actionable problems
 *  with your application. For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP 500 errors in your
 *  Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you that a memory pressure problem with your SQL Server
 *  database is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.
