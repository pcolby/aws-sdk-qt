 * \class QtAws::IoTAnalytics::ListChannelsResponse
 * \brief The ListChannelsResponse class provides an interace for IoTAnalytics ListChannels responses.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsIoTAnalytics
 *
 *  AWS IoT Analytics provides advanced data analysis for AWS IoT. It allows you to collect large amounts of device data,
 *  process messages, store them, and then query the data and run sophisticated analytics to make accurate decisions in your
 *  IoT applications and machine learning use cases. AWS IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration
 *  with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration with Amazon
 * 
 *  QuickSight>
 * 
 *  Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data often comes from
 *  devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result, the data from these devices
 *  can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur.
 *  Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AWS IoT Analytics automates each of the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics filters,
 *  transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service
 *  to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the
 *  data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data
 *  by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning
 *  inference. AWS IoT Analytics includes models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are
 *  about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable
