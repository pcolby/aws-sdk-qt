 * \class QtAws::AppConfig::GetDeploymentRequest
 * \brief The GetDeploymentRequest class provides an interface for AppConfig GetDeployment requests.
 *
 * \inmodule QtAwsAppConfig
 *
 *  Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy application
 *  configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation
 *  checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers,
 *  mobile applications, or IoT
 * 
 *  devices>
 * 
 *  To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could
 *  cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure
 *  that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you
 *  provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration
 *  deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is
 * 
 *  valid>
 * 
 *  During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If
 *  the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can
 *  configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including
 *  velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig
 *  automatically rolls back to the previous version.
 * 
 *  </p
 * 
 *  AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some
 * 
 *  examples> <ul> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch
 *  or announcement.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with
 *  production
 * 
 *  traffic> </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content.
 * 
 *  </p </li> <li>
 * 
 *  <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor
 *  impacts the
 * 
 *  system> </li> </ul>
