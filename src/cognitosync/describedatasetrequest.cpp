 *  <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname>
 * 
 *  Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of application-related
 *  user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist
 *  data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the
 *  mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User
 *  data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
 * 
 *  identity>
 * 
 *  With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity.
 *  In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Cognito Identity
 * 
 *  service</a>>
 * 
 *  If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via the AWS
 *  Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a
 *  href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for Android</a>
